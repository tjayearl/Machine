# Machines: Buy and Sell Cars

## Overview
The **Machines** website allows users to buy and sell cars, including tractors, sedans, SUVs, luxury cars, and sports cars. It is a simple, user-friendly platform that allows people to post vehicles for sale, browse available cars, and manage their listings. The site includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for managing vehicle listings, and it leverages modern JavaScript techniques, including Fetch API, event listeners, and DOM manipulation.

## Features
- **Buy and Sell Cars:** Users can browse a variety of cars for sale and add new cars to the marketplace.
- **CRUD Operations:** Includes the ability to add, update, and delete car listings.
- **Interactive Interface:** Dynamic updates and interactions, such as form submissions and list management.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the website.
- **JavaScript**: For handling CRUD operations and dynamic DOM updates.
- **Fetch API**: To communicate with the back-end and handle data from `db.json`.
- **Vercel**: Deployed the website for easy access and sharing.
